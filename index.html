      <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <p>
        In my free time, I find joy in a variety of activities that help me
        maintain a well-rounded life. One of my greatest pleasures is spending
        quality time with my wife. We often dedicate our weekends to visiting
        our families and nurturing those important relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a passion for learning and expanding my horizons. Reading and
        playing video games are two ways I indulge in personal growth and enjoy
        immersive storytelling. Additionally, my wife and I love outdoor
        activities such as hiking, camping, and exploring nature, as they
        provide us with a refreshing escape and an opportunity to stay active.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traveling is another interest that deeply enriches my life. Exploring
        different places and learning about diverse peoples and cultures
        fascinates me. It broadens my perspective and allows me to appreciate
        the beauty of our world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professionally, I find great satisfaction in working with databases, web
        design, and data analysis. I am always eager to deepen my knowledge and
        skills in these areas. Recently, I have embarked on an exciting journey
        with my brother, collaborating on building an iPhone app using Swift.
        Exploring new programming languages and tackling innovative projects
        invigorate my passion for technology and continuous learning.
