      <h2>Introducing Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Kylar Sorensen, and I'm actively seeking a full-time job or
        internship in the field of data science or the broader database
        industry. With just one class remaining, I am nearing completion of my
        bachelor's degree in applied technology at BYU-I.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my academic journey, I have gained extensive knowledge and
        practical experience in designing, creating, and managing databases. I
        have also honed my skills in machine learning using Python, enabling me
        to apply data-driven approaches to problem-solving effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a dedicated and motivated individual who consistently strives for
        excellence. With a track record of academic success, I have consistently
        ranked at the top of my class. As I approach graduation, I am eager to
        embark on a rewarding career where I can leverage my skills and continue
        my professional growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you know of any exciting opportunities or have connections in the
        field of databases or data science, I would greatly appreciate your
        assistance in connecting with potential employers and organizations. You
        can contact me <a href="about.html#contact-info">here</a>.
      </p>
