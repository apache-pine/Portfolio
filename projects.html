        <p><strong>Project Title: </strong>Data Science Programming - Python</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Project Description: </strong>This is a link to a repository
          that stores the five data science projects I worked on during my Intro
          to Data Science class. This is where my love for data science was
          born. A couple of the projects involved using some basic machine
          learning algorithms to make predictions. For each project we were
          given a scenario and several questions one might ask about the data
          that was provided. We were then responsible to wrangle and clean the
          data, then produce visualizations and answer the questions. The
          projects were done in Jupyter Notebooks and the code was written in
          Python.

          <strong>Project Description: </strong>This project was started as a
          way for me to learn how to program in C++. This is the first project I
          wrote in C++. Another goal for this project was to further my
          understanding of working with CSV files for data science and machine
          learning purposes. This program essentially takes a CSV file and
          cleans up the code, making it easier to work with in a data science or
          machine learning project.

          <strong>Project Description: </strong>This was the first project I
          wrote in Java when I was learning the language. It was once again a
          way for me to learn a new language, but to learn it and apply it in a
          way that fit into the field I was pursuing. This program will take a
          CSV file and output some basic summaries about the data to a new file
          written in Markdown.

          <strong>Project Title: </strong>Cloud Database Web App - Python and
          Django
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Project Description: </strong>This is a web app that I made
          using Python and Django. It is basically a console for accessing a
          cloud database I made for recording data about games of Among Us. I
          was watching a few streamers on Twitch play Among Us and was wondering
          about the stats of the games, such as who wins or loses the most,
          which roles are most successful, which roles get the most kills or are
          killed the most, etc. I had many questions that would be easy to
          answer if I could easily record the data from the games and later
          query it. So I built this web app to run CRUD statements from my
          browser in a web app.

        <p><strong>Project Title: </strong>.NET Core Web App - C#</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Project Description: </strong>A basic web app built using .NET
          Framework and C#. This web app was built to aid in preparing for
          sacrament meetings. It allows users to create a program for a
          sacrament meeting, with all the different roles one would expect in
          such a meeting. The program is saved in a database and can be edited
          at a later time. This program offers full CRUD operations in the
          database using Entity Framework. This was built specifically with the
          Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in mind, but could be used
          for any church or organization that has similar meetings.

          understand the functions of .NET Framework.

        <p><strong>Project Title: </strong>iOS To-Do List App - Swift</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Project Description: </strong>This is a simple iOS
          productivity app that is essentially a to-do list with a spin. The
          user can add items to a list and then check them off as they are
          completed. Each item on the list is given a level of urgency by the
          user. Based on the level of urgency, the item has a point value
          attached to it. As users complete more urgent tasks first, they will
          earn more points. The score is displayed at the top of the screen.
          Each item on the list can be edited and more items can be add. The
          items also have themes that can be changed so that users can color
          code their tasks.<br />
          I built this app as a chance to learn how to program in Swift. I built
          it by following a tutorial made by Apple about how to create a
          different app and just made the necessary changes to create the app I
          envisioned.

        <p><strong>Project Title: </strong>AWS RDS CLI Program - Python</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Project Description: </strong>This was a program I made to
          interact with the same Among Us database that the web app program was
          built to work with. This program was actually written first and was my
          first attempt at streamlining the CRUD operations into an app. This
          used a database that was hosted on AWS RDS and the program worked in
          the users command line. I later built the web app so that I could
          access the database from a GUI rather than in the command line.

          <strong>Project Description: </strong>This is a website that I
          hand-coded after getting proficient with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It
          is a mock Chamber of Commerce website built for Yakima, WA. It was
          built as part of an assignment for my Web Design class, but I was
          really proud with how it turned out. It is now hosted on GitHub Pages
          and can be view from the link below.
